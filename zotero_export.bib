	abstract = {Extraction of {DNA}, {RNA}, and protein is the basic method used in molecular biology. These biomolecules can be isolated from any biological material for subsequent downstream processes, analytical, or preparative purposes. In the past, the process of extraction and purification of nucleic acids used to be complicated, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and limited in terms of overall throughput. Currently, there are many specialized methods that can be used to extract pure biomolecules, such as solution-based and column-based protocols. Manual method has certainly come a long way over time with various commercial offerings which included complete kits containing most of the components needed to isolate nucleic acid, but most of them require repeated centrifugation steps, followed by removal of supernatants depending on the type of specimen and additional mechanical treatment. Automated systems designed for medium-to-large laboratories have grown in demand over recent years. It is an alternative to labor-intensive manual methods. The technology should allow a high throughput of samples; the yield, purity, reproducibility, and scalability of the biomolecules as well as the speed, accuracy, and reliability of the assay should be maximal, while minimizing the risk of cross-contamination.},

            {MicroRNAs} ({miRNAs}) are abundant inside cells, where they regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally, but are also found in circulation as remarkably stable extracellular constituents of body fluids such as human blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. We observed that these circulating {miRNAs} are predominantly associated with free Argonaut 2 ({AGO}2) complexes that are accessible to immunoprecipitation by {AGO}2 antibodies and are able to base-pair with complementary target {RNAs}, suggesting that, under normal physiological conditions, circulating {miRNAs} are largely contained in functional {miRNA}-mediated silencing complexes ({miRISCs}). However, we observe that, under certain pathological conditions, more {miRNAs} become associated with complexes other than free {AGO}2/{miRISC}, suggesting that the assortment of circulating {miRNAs} into distinct complexes offers a potential new dimension to {miRNA}-based diagnostics.

            {MicroRNAs} ({miRNAs}) function cell-intrinsically to regulate gene expression by base-pairing to complementary {mRNA} targets while in association with Argonaute, the effector protein of the {miRNA}-mediated silencing complex ({miRISC}). A relatively dilute population of {miRNAs} can be found extracellularly in body fluids such as human blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}). The remarkable stability of circulating {miRNAs} in such harsh extracellular environments can be attributed to their association with protective macromolecular complexes, including extracellular vesicles ({EVs}), proteins such as Argonaut 2 ({AGO}2), or high-density lipoproteins. The precise origins and the potential biological significance of various forms of {miRNA}-containing extracellular complexes are poorly understood. It is also not known whether extracellular {miRNAs} in their native state may retain the capacity for {miRISC}-mediated target {RNA} binding. To explore the potential functionality of circulating extracellular {miRNAs}, we comprehensively investigated the association between circulating {miRNAs} and the {miRISC} Argonaute {AGO}2. Using {AGO}2 immunoprecipitation ({IP}) followed by small-{RNA} sequencing, we find that {miRNAs} in circulation are primarily associated with antibody-accessible {miRISC}/{AGO}2 complexes. Moreover, we show that circulating {miRNAs} can base-pair with a target mimic in a seed-based manner, and that the target-bound {AGO}2 can be recovered from blood plasma in an ∼1:1 ratio with the respective {miRNA}. Our findings suggest that {miRNAs} in circulation are largely contained in functional {miRISC}/{AGO}2 complexes under normal physiological conditions. However, we find that, in human {CSF}, the assortment of certain extracellular {miRNAs} into free {miRISC}/{AGO}2 complexes can be affected by pathological conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

	abstract = {The {RNA}-induced silencing complex ({RISC}), which powers {RNA} interference ({RNAi}), consists of a guide {RNA} and an Argonaute protein that slices target {RNAs} complementary to the guide. We ﬁnd that, for different guide-{RNA} sequences, slicing rates of perfectly complementary bound targets can be surprisingly different ({\textgreater}250-fold range), and that faster slicing confers better knockdown in cells. Nucleotide sequence identities at guide-{RNA} positions 7, 10, and 17 underlie much of this variation in slicing rates. Analysis of one of these determinants implicates a structural distortion at guide nucleotides 6–7 in promoting slicing. Moreover, slicing directed by different guide sequences has an unanticipated, 600-fold range in 30-mismatch tolerance, attributable to guides with weak ({AU}-rich) central pairing requiring extensive 30 complementarity (pairing beyond position 16) to more fully populate the slicing-competent conformation. Together, our analyses identify sequence determinants of {RISC} activity and provide biochemical and conformational rationale for their action.},
